### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Configuration Troubleshooting for Cassandra Snitch
---

This incident type involves troubleshooting the configuration for the snitch in a Cassandra database. The snitch is responsible for determining the network topology of the nodes in the cluster. When there is an issue with the snitch configuration, it can lead to communication problems between nodes and can cause the cluster to become unstable or fail. The incident may involve identifying and resolving configuration errors, testing the cluster's connectivity, and ensuring that the snitch is properly configured to reflect the current network topology.

### Parameters
```shell
export PATH_TO_CASSANDRA_YAML="PLACEHOLDER"

export NODE_IP="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_SNITCH_CONFIG="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_CASSANDRA_HOME_DIRECTORY="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check the snitch configuration file
```shell
cat ${PATH_TO_CASSANDRA_YAML} | grep snitch
```

### Check the status of the Cassandra service
```shell
systemctl status cassandra
```

### Check the cluster status
```shell
nodetool status
```

### Check the logs for errors related to the snitch
```shell
tail -f /var/log/cassandra/system.log | grep snitch
```

### Verify the network configuration
```shell
ip addr show
```

### Check the firewall rules
```shell
iptables -L
```

### Check the connectivity between nodes
```shell
ping ${NODE_IP}
```

### Check the consistency level of the queries
```shell
nodetool describecluster | grep consistency
```

### An incorrect snitch configuration due to a human error during the initial setup or changes made to the configuration file.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set variables

SNITCH_CONFIG=${PATH_TO_SNITCH_CONFIG}



# Check if snitch configuration file exists

if [ ! -f "$SNITCH_CONFIG" ]; then

  echo "ERROR: Snitch configuration file not found at $SNITCH_CONFIG"

  exit 1

fi



# Check if snitch configuration is valid

if ! grep -q "endpoint_snitch" "$SNITCH_CONFIG"; then

  echo "ERROR: endpoint_snitch configuration not found in $SNITCH_CONFIG"

  exit 1

fi



# Check if snitch configuration is current

CURRENT_SNITCH=$(nodetool getendpoints system.local | awk '{print $NF}')

CONFIGURED_SNITCH=$(grep endpoint_snitch "$SNITCH_CONFIG" | awk '{print $NF}' | tr -d "'")

if [ "$CURRENT_SNITCH" != "$CONFIGURED_SNITCH" ]; then

  echo "ERROR: Current snitch ($CURRENT_SNITCH) does not match configured snitch ($CONFIGURED_SNITCH)"

  exit 1

fi



echo "Snitch configuration is correct"

exit 0
